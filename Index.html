                <h1>Intro</h1>
                <h3>Growing up, i used to watch a lot of TV ahows ranging from reality to cartoons to anime 
                    and throughout that time period I grew used to watching different types of shows to the point where it 
                    became apart of who I am today. But i always wondered what would happen it two universes collided so 
                    i thought what if Jin Mori or Jin Mo-Ri from The God Of Highschool was in Kickin' it on Disney XD.

            <h1>Jin Mori</h1>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>At least 1000+ years before the start of the G.O.H plot, when the monkey king was young he went to the Heavenly Realm and challenged the gods there eventually gaining a reputation of killing the gods he encountered.
               At least 600+ years before the start of the G.O.H plot, the monkey king along with the Nine Kings of the Sage Realm went to war with the Heavenly Realm. He eventually fought against the Nine-Tails Guardian but to the monkey kings dismay their fight was interrupted and the king was captured and put into the Eight Trigrams Jail. Although he was imprisoned, he eventually broke out with the help of his army giving him strength. The war lasted for many years but it inevitably ended with the loss of the Sage Realm. Mo - Ri eventually fought against them once again, fighting against Buddha and the Jade Emperor but was captured and upon his return he acted as an emissary between the gods and the Sage Realm. However something happened that caused him to disappear and regress into the form of a baby and encase himself in a crystal.
               At least 20+ years before the start of the God of High School plot, Jin Tae-Jin and his RE Taekwondo Force was on a mission called Mission Gilgamesh in North Korea. After a huge fight with one of the fur clones of the Monkey King, where Tae-Jin won, the fur clone gave Mo-Ri, encased in a green crystal, to Tae-Jin to watch over and protect. Seventeen years prior to the start during the fight against Jin Tae-Jin and the Six he emerged from the crystal causing a massive explosion and led to the defeat of Kim Oong-Nyuh. He was later raised in the mountains and trained by Tae-Jin until he was around eight years old when he was sent to school to make friends and be around other people in the city. He learned Renewal Taekwondo from his grandfather and is most exceptional at it, being one of the strongest competitors in the G.O.H tournament.</p>

                <h1>Accomplishments</h1>
                <p>Jin Mo-Ri survived the effect of the Sage's Pill. Na Bong-Chim believes it is due to Jin being capable of holding more energy than the single pill was able to generate. This is later turned out to be a result of him being an inhabitant of the Sage Realm which the fruit has no detrimental effect on. In the past, Sun Wukong stuff himself with sage pills that only come once every thousand years. After eating sage pills, Jin Mo-Ri learned to remove his limiter and exponentially increasing his power.
                After entering Lord of the Heavens mode and fully regaining his powers and memories, Jin Mo-Ri has been stated to be on the same level as the First Crown Prince, even eventually defeating him. After the destruction of Oraeguk and his journey through space and the Heavenly Realm, his ability increased substantially as he trained them while he was stranded on the planet that houses The Skyscraper. This was proven later on, when he was able to fight multiple realm masters simultaneously whilst maintaining the upper hand.
                After his loop of binding was broken by 666:Satan, his base state's physical power increased considerably.</p>

                <h1>Skills</h1>
                <p>Jin Mo-Ri uses Renewal Taekwondo, a martial art created and taught to him by his grandfather. All his attacks emphasize speed and power. 
                    He only uses his legs when an opponent is deemed worthy otherwise he'll use a combo of punches to beat his opponent. His level is usually 6 but it rises to 13 when he fights seriously 
                    using his legs.</p>
